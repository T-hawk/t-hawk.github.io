            This was my first and longest project. I started work on it in July of 2018, and continued to work on it until early 2020. The idea was to provide a space for cubers (people who enjoy solivng Rubik&#39;s cubes or other similar puzzles) to hangout and chat. It was my first deepdive into rails and I learned a lot about backend as well as front end design.

As you can see the UI heavily features gradients. It definetely works in some places, but looks bad in others. Although it might not look the greatest, this project was a great learning experience, and I learned how to design a website from the ground up. I had an IOS version of the app in the works, but never quite completed it. The github repo for the mobile version is <a class="text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-600" href="https://github.com/T-hawk/cubemunity-mobile">here</a>
