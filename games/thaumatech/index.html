            This was a game that I have worked on over the course of 2 years, but never quite finished. The scope was always way too ambitious, and I would get motivation to start working on it, but always quit after a while. The point of the game was to be able to choose between being a wizard and a steampunk. The world was completely based around a conflict between the Thaumancers (wizards) and the Steampunks.

<p class="text-lg">I experimented with different genres to put the game in. I originally wanted the game to be a 3D first person shooter with a massive open world. But that dream quickly died off as a realized the difficulty of developing a 3D game. Unfortunately, I do not have any screenshots from this version becaues it was so short lived.</p>
<hr class="border-2 rounded-lg m-7" />
<p class="text-lg">The next genre I explored was a 2D topdown shooter game.</p>
<br />

<p class="text-md mt-2 text-center">The art was from a free asset pack, and I was planning on doing all the art after I finished the gameplay. Much of the gameplay was functional at this point.</p>
<br />
<img class="rounded-lg shadow-xl" src="/images/thaumatech/topdown2.png" alt="2D Topdown">
<p class="text-md mt-2 text-center">You could choose between the two different classes: Mechanic and Thaumncer. This is gameplay from a Thaumancer (you can tell because he's holding a wand).</p>
<br />
<img class="rounded-lg shadow-xl" src="/images/thaumatech/topdown3.png" alt="2D Topdown">
<p class="text-md mt-2 text-center">I added chests that could be opened and looted. I created a pretty sophisticated item system that allowed for random items to fill chests.</p>
<hr class="border-2 rounded-lg m-7" />
<p class="text-lg">Lastly, I landed on making the game a platformer / metroidvania. The shooter elements, of course, remained.</p>
<br/>
<img class="rounded-lg shadow-xl" src="/images/thaumatech/thaumatech-platformer1.png" alt="Platformer">
<p class="text-md mt-2 text-center">The artstyle was obviously not completely hammered down, but the basic gameplay was implemented.</p>
<br/>
<img class="rounded-lg shadow-xl" src="/images/thaumatech/thaumatech-platformer2.png" alt="Platformer">
<p class="text-md mt-2 text-center">The inventory was fully implemented as well.</p>
